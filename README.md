Project Description :
A forum site known as Lets Vent Out is a place to let people know they are not alone, no matter what theyâ€™re going through. Each reader has an opportunity to post any question or random thought and other users will post answers to his/her question and thought. Categories are already defined for people so that they can post relevantly and access quickly. People can also delete and update their questions whenever they want. There is a video gallery and care corner too. People can watch inspirational videos of different categories and can find therapist in their city. User should be logged in to answer or post a question but people can view motivational and videos without logging in. Moreover, they can also get info about psychologists/therapists of their city.
